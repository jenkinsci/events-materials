= Jenkins Events Materials

This repository is meant to be the home for events materials such as proposals,
re-usable presentations, and other such content.

== JAM Spread and CloudBees Hive

The Jenkins Area Meetup "Spread" is a monthly release
intended to help JAM Organizers have fun, clear, consistent, and interesting meetups.
To use it JAM organizers should copy the slide deck and customize the content to their JAM.
The Hive is much much smaller and simpler.  It will include a set of slides highlighting something new and interesting created or offered by CloudBees.
Feedback and suggestions for improving the Spread and the Hive should be sent to
`jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com`
or discussed in the #jenkins-community IRC channel.
